  # We use a with statement (see pep-0343 for details) to automatically close the socket when we are done
  ## It's important to close sockets after you are done with them.
  ## We pass two arguments to socket:
  ### s.AF_INET says we are using an address from the internet
  ### s.SOCK_STREAM says we are using a TCP socket
  # Note the difference between the socket module (which we are referring to as 's' per line 12),
  ## and our own socket which we are naming socket
  with s.socket(s.AF_INET, s.SOCK_STREAM) as socket:
    
    # Connect our socket.  Notice that we pull server port directly from our TCPServer class.
    ## Q: Why is this step not in our UDP client?

      (server_host, TCPServer.SERVER_PORT)
    )
    
    # Send data, encoded as a UTF-8 bytestream
    socket.send(message.encode())
    
    # Wait for a response
    ## note, we won't move beyond this point until there is something to recieve from the socket
    response = socket.recv(1024)
